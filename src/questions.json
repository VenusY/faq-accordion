    "question": "Tell me about yourself",
    "answer": "Hey! My name is Venus Yip, and I'm a self-taught programmer. I would describe myself as a curious person who has always loved learning new things, and one of my favourite pastimes is building projects! Outside of work, I also enjoy reading and gamingâ€”I especially love puzzle games!\nI initially wanted to go into law, but after briefly learning Python, I discovered my passion for software development.\nSince then, I've been independently learning programming and web development. I've mainly worked with frontend languages, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I've also built projects with some tools, frameworks, and libraries related to these languages, including React and Sass.\nRecently, as part of my journey to becoming a software developer, I've begun to explore backend development as well, which I've found super interesting so far!"

    "question": "What do you do in your spare time?",
    "answer": "In my spare time, I enjoy learning more about web development and programming in general. I also love building personal projects to both explore new technologies and consolidate my knowledge on technologies that I've already used, which allows me to practice my problem-solving and research skills.\nI'm currently building lots of different projects with React in order to improve my skills and knowledge in that area, and I also plan on finishing my weather app, which will help me learn more about backend development, a topic I'm eager to explore further.\nYou'll often find me reading or gaming when I'm not working. I read a wide variety of books that cover topics I find interesting, including space, philosophy, and psychology. In fact, I'm currently reading 'Think', which is a book that serves as an introduction to philosophy!\n When it comes to gaming, I enjoy a diverse range of genres, but most notably, I enjoy puzzle games and competitive games that require teamwork."

    "question": "What is your greatest strength?",
    "answer": "I would say my greatest strength is resilience. My resilience is the main reason I've been able to stay motivated while independently learning programming and web development over the last three years.\nThroughout my journey, I've ran into many issues. From bugs that had me wondering how I missed something so simple to having difficulty understanding certain concepts.\nI owe it to my resilience that I was able to overcome all these obstacles and learn as much as I have."

  {
    "question": "What is your greatest weakness?",
    "answer": "My greatest weakness is public speaking. I've always been quite the introvert, and while I don't dislike talking to people, I definitely would not claim it energises me either to say the least!\nHowever, this is something that I would like to overcome in the future, and I've taken steps towards that. In order to minimise my nerves and insecurities in public speaking situations, I make sure I prepare a lot beforehand to quell my worries that I'll say something embarrassing, and I've found that this has helped a lot with my confidence."

  {
    "question": "What are your career goals?",
    "answer": "I aspire to be a well-rounded software developer with vast knowledge of many different technologies.\nI would love to work for a company that provides interesting products or services that improve the everyday lives of the people who use them.\nIn the future, I hope to have enough experience and skill to be able to tackle any project with confidence and with the ability to make quick and effective decisions."
