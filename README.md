A challenge from Frontend Mentor that I adapted into my personal FAQ page where I give answers to common interview questions!

## Why I Built This Project

I built this project to gain more experience with building an FAQ accordion, which is a common frontend pattern.

The project was originally a challenge from Frontend Mentor, but I changed it to display common interview questions and my answers to them as I thought this was a good way to both practice my skills and display my creativity.

I decided to build this project with React and Sass to improve my skills in both technologies.
